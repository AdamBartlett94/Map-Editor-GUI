# Map-Editor-GUI
This project was the last assignment given by the Event Driven Computing course I took as one of my computer science electives. We were required to use Java’s Swing widget to develop a map editor GUI that could both represent and modify the location of places and roads on a map, with the end goal being to visually represent the shortest distance between any two places.

The majority of the focus was based on the functionality of the GUI itself, some of the requirements included: 
  - Having the ability to load or save the current map to or from a custom .map file
  - Creating new places or roads on the GUI using input from the user
  - Moving places by dragging them around the screen
  - Creating a selection box to select multiple places at once
  - Selecting or deselecting the start and end locations for the distance calculation
  - Calculating and highlighting the shortest distance between two points once selected
  - Etc…
Overall I completed all of the default and bonus requirements for this assignment except for the ability to calculate the shortest distance between points. I was going to use Dijkstra's algorithm to implement this functionality but decided against it. The reason behind this being that I had already completed enough to obtain 100% of the grade for the assignment and therefore decided to focus my attention towards exam revision.

Future Work:
  - Finish off the shortest path functionality using Dijkstra's algorithm
  - Use what I learnt from this assignment to help develop the GUI for my spy furby project (coming soon!)
